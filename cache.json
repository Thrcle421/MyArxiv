We observe the surprising fact that for\nreasoning tasks, shorter traces are much more likely to be correct than longer\nones. Motivated by this, we introduce First Finish Search (FFS), a\ntraining-free parallel decoding strategy that launches $n$ independent samples\nand returns as soon as any one completes. We evaluate FFS alongside simple\ndecoding, beam search, majority voting, and budget forcing on four reasoning\nmodels (DeepSeek-R1, R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, QwQ-32B and Phi-4-Reasoning-Plus) and\nacross four datasets (AIME24, AIME25-I, AIME25-II and GPQA Diamond). With\nDeepSeek-R1, FFS achieves $82.23\\%$ accuracy on the AIME datasets, a $15\\%$\nimprovement over DeepSeek-R1's standalone accuracy, nearly matching OpenAI's\no4-mini performance. Our theoretical analysis explains why stopping at the\nshortest trace is likely to yield a correct answer and identifies the\nconditions under which early stopping may be suboptimal.

However, RLHF often\nsuffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the\nreward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the\nidiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is\niterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated\nhuman feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption,\nthe dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In\nthis work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in\niterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model\ntraining data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used\nfor optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled\nAlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over\nsuccessive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth\npreferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while\nreinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation\nflexibility.

A common mitigation is to keep\nthe benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions\nto the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single\norganization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries.\nTo overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without\ncompletely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still\nmaintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject\nrandomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and\nonly include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the\nbest possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is\nthis helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach\nalso offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully\ncapable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this\nceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data\ncontamination.

Solving these tasks often involves long\ninference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to\nexpedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks,\nexploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown\nthat LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation\nframeworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent\nsub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks\nmay not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their\napplicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM\n\"workers\" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated\nattention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our\napproach allows the LLM instances to come up with their own collaboration\nstrategy for the problem at hand, all the while \"seeing\" each other's memory in\nthe concurrent KV cache.

A prerequisite for this vision is understanding how well\nan AI model can identify the underlying structure of a black-box system from\nits behavior. In this paper, we explore how well a large language model (LLM)\nlearns to identify a black-box function from passively observed versus actively\ncollected data. We investigate the reverse-engineering capabilities of LLMs\nacross three distinct types of black-box systems, each chosen to represent\ndifferent problem domains where future autonomous AI researchers may have\nconsiderable impact: Program, Formal Language, and Math Equation. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that LLMs fail to extract information from\nobservations, reaching a performance plateau that falls short of the ideal of\nBayesian inference. However, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to not only\nobserve but also intervene -- actively querying the black-box with specific\ninputs to observe the resulting output -- improves performance by allowing LLMs\nto test edge cases and refine their beliefs. By providing the intervention data\nfrom one LLM to another, we show that this improvement is partly a result of\nengaging in the process of generating effective interventions, paralleling\nresults in the literature on human learning. Further analysis reveals that\nengaging in intervention can help LLMs escape from two common failure modes:\novercomplication, where the LLM falsely assumes prior knowledge about the\nblack-box, and overlooking, where the LLM fails to incorporate observations.\nThese insights provide practical guidance for helping LLMs more effectively\nreverse-engineer black-box systems, supporting their use in making new\ndiscoveries.\n","authors":["Jiayi Geng","Howard Chen","Dilip Arumugam","Thomas L.

Autoregressive models typically rely on image\ntokenizers to compress images into discrete tokens for sequential prediction,\nwhereas diffusion models often operate on continuous latent space to reduce\ncomputational costs. However, both visual compression approaches inevitably\nlose visual information, thereby limiting the upper bound of visual generation\nquality. To evaluate how these compression losses affect text and faces, the\nmost human-sensitive visual elements, we first collect and curate a collection\nof text and faces images from existing datasets, ensuring clarity and\ndiversity. For text reconstruction, we employ OCR models to assess the\nrecognition accuracy of the reconstructed text, and then we measure feature\nsimilarity between original and reconstructed faces thereby quantifying faces\nreconstruction fidelity.

In\nthis paper, we address this problem by enabling temperature-modulated\nrepresentation learning using our novel negative cosine scheduling scheme. Our\nscheduling lets the model form a coarse decision boundary at the beginning of\ntraining by focusing on fewer neighbors, and gradually prioritizes more\nneighbors to smooth out rough edges. This gradual task switching leads to a\nricher and more generalizable representation space. While other OSR methods\nbenefit by including regularization or auxiliary negative samples, such as with\nmix-up, thereby adding a significant computational overhead, our scheme can be\nfolded into any existing OSR method with no overhead.

Additionally, we incorporate a Sampling-then-Moving\nAverage (SMA) technique, interpolating sampled weights from stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) training to obtain the moving average weights, ensuring smooth\ntemporal behavior and minimizing training state variances. Overall, our method\nsignificantly reduces training space dimensions and the number of trainable\nparameters without sacrificing model performance, thus accelerating model\nconvergence. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the Noisy quadratic\nmodel, showing that the proposed method achieves a lower training variance than\nstandard SGD.

Traditional black-box methods have\ngenerally focused on improving the optimization framework (e.g., utilizing\nmomentum in MI-FGSM) to enhance transferability, rather than examining the\ndependency on surrogate white-box model architectures. Recent state-of-the-art\napproach DiffPGD has demonstrated enhanced transferability by employing\ndiffusion-based adversarial purification models for adaptive attacks. The\ninductive bias of diffusion-based adversarial purification aligns naturally\nwith the adversarial attack process, where both involving noise addition,\nreducing dependency on surrogate white-box model selection. However, the\ndenoising process of diffusion models incurs substantial computational costs\nthrough chain rule derivation, manifested in excessive VRAM consumption and\nextended runtime.

Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a recent prominent method that\nencourages models to generate complete reasoning traces before answering,\nleading to increased token usage and computational cost. Inspired by the\nhuman-like thinking process-where people skip reasoning for easy questions but\nthink carefully when needed-we explore how to enable VLMs to first decide when\nreasoning is necessary. To realize this, we propose TON, a two-stage training\nstrategy: (i) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage with a simple yet effective\n'thought dropout' operation, where reasoning traces are randomly replaced with\nempty thoughts. This introduces a think-or-not format that serves as a cold\nstart for selective reasoning; (ii) a GRPO stage that enables the model to\nfreely explore when to think or not, while maximizing task-aware outcome\nrewards. Experimental results show that TON can reduce the completion length by\nup to 90% compared to vanilla GRPO, without sacrificing performance or even\nimproving it. Further evaluations across diverse vision-language tasks-covering\na range of reasoning difficulties under both 3B and 7B models-consistently\nreveal that the model progressively learns to bypass unnecessary reasoning\nsteps as training advances.

This alignment facilitates shape reconstruction by enabling the\napplication of rigid object reconstruction techniques, and supports recovering\nthe input pose in voxel representation as part of the reconstruction task,\nutilizing both the original and deformed depth images. Notably, our model\nachieves effective results with only a small dataset of approximately 300\nsamples.

A key trend involves\nleveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue\nstructures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1)\ninsufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales\n(e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual\nmodalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a\nhierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph\nconsisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x)\nvisual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2)\nheterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same\nscale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a\ntwo-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly\ncorrelated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to\nalign textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast,\nlung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently\noutperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving\ngains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings.

Classical handcrafted methods such as SIFT feature\ndetection and description combined with nearest neighbour matching and RANSAC\noutlier removal have been state-of-the-art for mobile mapping cameras. With\nrecent advances in deep learning, learnable methods have been introduced and\nproven to have better robustness and performance under complex conditions.\nDespite their growing adoption, a comprehensive comparison between classical\nand learnable feature matching methods for the specific task of semantic 3D\nbuilding camera-to-model matching is still missing. This submission\nsystematically evaluates the effectiveness of different feature-matching\ntechniques in visual localization using textured CityGML LoD2 models. We use\nstandard benchmark datasets (HPatches, MegaDepth-1500) and custom datasets\nconsisting of facade textures and corresponding camera images (terrestrial and\ndrone). For the latter, we evaluate the achievable accuracy of the absolute\npose estimated using a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm, with geometric\nground truth derived from geo-referenced trajectory data.

The above characterization scheme enables\nthe interpretable gradient TR factors to inherit the low-rankness and\nsmoothness of the original background. To further enhance anomaly detection, we\ndesign a generalized nonconvex regularization term to exploit the group\nsparsity of the anomaly component.

Existing transferable attack methods face two major challenges: 1)\nthey heavily rely on the assumption that the decision boundaries of the\nsurrogate (a.k.a., source) model and the target model are similar, which limits\nthe adversarial transferability; and 2) their decision boundary difference\nmakes the attack direction uncertain, which may result in the gradient\noscillation, weakening the adversarial attack. This motivates us to propose a\nBackground Mixup-induced Temporal Consistency (BMTC) attack method for action\nrecognition. From the input transformation perspective, we design a\nmodel-agnostic background adversarial mixup module to reduce the\nsurrogate-target model dependency. In particular, we randomly sample one video\nfrom each category and make its background frame, while selecting the\nbackground frame with the top attack ability for mixup with the clean frame by\nreinforcement learning. Moreover, to ensure an explicit attack direction, we\nleverage the background category as guidance for updating the gradient of\nadversarial example, and design a temporal gradient consistency loss, which\nstrengthens the stability of the attack direction on subsequent frames.\nEmpirical studies on two video datasets, i.e., UCF101 and Kinetics-400, and one\nimage dataset, i.e., ImageNet, demonstrate that our method significantly boosts\nthe transferability of adversarial examples across several action/image\nrecognition models.

Existing\nBEV-based 3D object detection methods, typically adhering to angle-based\nrepresentation, directly estimate the size and orientation of rotated bounding\nboxes. We observe that BEV-based 3D object detection is analogous to aerial\noriented object detection, where angle-based methods are recognized for being\naffected by discontinuities in their loss functions. Drawing inspiration from\nthis domain, we propose Restricted Quadrilateral Representation to define 3D\nregression targets. RQR3D regresses the smallest horizontal bounding box\nencapsulating the oriented box, along with the offsets between the corners of\nthese two boxes, thereby transforming the oriented object detection problem\ninto a keypoint regression task. RQR3D is compatible with any 3D object\ndetection approach. We employ RQR3D within an anchor-free single-stage object\ndetection method and introduce an objectness head to address class imbalance\nproblem.

To address these\nlimitations, this paper proposes CAS-IQA, a vision-language model (VLM)-based\nframework that predicts fine-grained quality scores by effectively\nincorporating auxiliary information from related images. In the absence of\nangiography datasets, CAS-3K is constructed, comprising 3,565 synthetic\nangiographies along with score annotations. To ensure clinically meaningful\nassessment, three task-specific evaluation metrics are defined. Furthermore, a\nMulti-path featUre fuSion and rouTing (MUST) module is designed to enhance\nimage representations by adaptively fusing and routing visual tokens to\nmetric-specific branches.

While TTS has\ndemonstrated significant success across multiple language tasks, there remains\na notable gap in understanding the test-time scaling behaviors of image and\nvideo generative models (diffusion-based or flow-based models). Although recent\nworks have initiated exploration into inference-time strategies for vision\ntasks, these approaches face critical limitations: being constrained to\ntask-specific domains, exhibiting poor scalability, or falling into reward\nover-optimization that sacrifices sample diversity. In this paper, we propose\n\\textbf{Evo}lutionary \\textbf{Search} (EvoSearch), a novel, generalist, and\nefficient TTS method that effectively enhances the scalability of both image\nand video generation across diffusion and flow models, without requiring\nadditional training or model expansion. EvoSearch reformulates test-time\nscaling for diffusion and flow models as an evolutionary search problem,\nleveraging principles from biological evolution to efficiently explore and\nrefine the denoising trajectory. By incorporating carefully designed selection\nand mutation mechanisms tailored to the stochastic differential equation\ndenoising process, EvoSearch iteratively generates higher-quality offspring\nwhile preserving population diversity.

This compromises 3D consistency,\nas we observe significant identity changes when re-synthesizing the 3D head\nwith each camera shift. Conversely, fixing the camera to a single viewpoint\nyields high-quality renderings for that perspective but results in poor\nperformance for novel views. Removing view-conditioning typically destabilizes\nGAN training, often causing the training to collapse. In response to these\nchallenges, we introduce CGS-GAN, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting GAN framework\nthat enables stable training and high-quality 3D-consistent synthesis of human\nheads without relying on view-conditioning. To ensure training stability, we\nintroduce a multi-view regularization technique that enhances generator\nconvergence with minimal computational overhead.

Using the controlled\nAlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over\nsuccessive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth\npreferences.

Classical handcrafted methods such as SIFT feature\ndetection and description combined with nearest neighbour matching and RANSAC\noutlier removal have been state-of-the-art for mobile mapping cameras. With\nrecent advances in deep learning, learnable methods have been introduced and\nproven to have better robustness and performance under complex conditions.\nDespite their growing adoption, a comprehensive comparison between classical\nand learnable feature matching methods for the specific task of semantic 3D\nbuilding camera-to-model matching is still missing. This submission\nsystematically evaluates the effectiveness of different feature-matching\ntechniques in visual localization using textured CityGML LoD2 models. We use\nstandard benchmark datasets (HPatches, MegaDepth-1500) and custom datasets\nconsisting of facade textures and corresponding camera images (terrestrial and\ndrone). For the latter, we evaluate the achievable accuracy of the absolute\npose estimated using a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm, with geometric\nground truth derived from geo-referenced trajectory data.

A prerequisite for this vision is understanding how well\nan AI model can identify the underlying structure of a black-box system from\nits behavior. In this paper, we explore how well a large language model (LLM)\nlearns to identify a black-box function from passively observed versus actively\ncollected data. We investigate the reverse-engineering capabilities of LLMs\nacross three distinct types of black-box systems, each chosen to represent\ndifferent problem domains where future autonomous AI researchers may have\nconsiderable impact: Program, Formal Language, and Math Equation. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that LLMs fail to extract information from\nobservations, reaching a performance plateau that falls short of the ideal of\nBayesian inference. However, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to not only\nobserve but also intervene -- actively querying the black-box with specific\ninputs to observe the resulting output -- improves performance by allowing LLMs\nto test edge cases and refine their beliefs. By providing the intervention data\nfrom one LLM to another, we show that this improvement is partly a result of\nengaging in the process of generating effective interventions, paralleling\nresults in the literature on human learning. Further analysis reveals that\nengaging in intervention can help LLMs escape from two common failure modes:\novercomplication, where the LLM falsely assumes prior knowledge about the\nblack-box, and overlooking, where the LLM fails to incorporate observations.\nThese insights provide practical guidance for helping LLMs more effectively\nreverse-engineer black-box systems, supporting their use in making new\ndiscoveries.\n","authors":["Jiayi Geng","Howard Chen","Dilip Arumugam","Thomas L.

To address these issues, we propose a normalization approach,\nNormalized AOPC (NAOPC), enabling consistent cross-model evaluations and more\nmeaningful interpretation of individual scores.

This limitation results in suboptimal detection performance. To\nmitigate this critical issue, we put forward a novel HAD method named\nHAD-EUNTRFR, which incorporates an enhanced unified nonconvex tensor ring (TR)\nfactors regularization. In the HAD-EUNTRFR framework, the raw HSIs are first\ndecomposed into background and anomaly components. The TR decomposition is then\nemployed to capture the spatial-spectral correlations within the background\ncomponent. Additionally, we introduce a unified and efficient nonconvex\nregularizer, induced by tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD), to\nsimultaneously encode the low-rankness and sparsity of the 3-D gradient TR\nfactors into a unique concise form. The above characterization scheme enables\nthe interpretable gradient TR factors to inherit the low-rankness and\nsmoothness of the original background.

(2). The similarity graph\nstructure directly derived from the original feature space is suboptimal for\nmulti-label problems in existing graph-based methods, leading to unreliable\nsoft labels and degraded feature selection performance. To overcome them, we\npropose a consistent sparse graph learning method for multi-label\nsemi-supervised feature selection (SGMFS), which can enhance the feature\nselection performance by maintaining space consistency and learning label\ncorrelations in semi-supervised scenarios. Specifically, for Challenge (1),\nSGMFS learns a low-dimensional and independent label subspace from the\nprojected features, which can compatibly cross multiple labels and effectively\nachieve the label correlations. For Challenge (2), instead of constructing a\nfixed similarity graph for semi-supervised learning, SGMFS thoroughly explores\nthe intrinsic structure of the data by performing sparse reconstruction of\nsamples in both the label space and the learned subspace simultaneously. In\nthis way, the similarity graph can be adaptively learned to maintain the\nconsistency between label space and the learned subspace, which can promote\npropagating proper soft labels for unlabeled samples, facilitating the ultimate\nfeature selection.

However, they are often sensitive to small\ninput changes. Hence, to prevent unexpected behavior in safety-critical\napplications, their formal verification -- a notoriously hard problem -- is\nnecessary. Many state-of-the-art verification algorithms use reachability\nanalysis or abstract interpretation to enclose the set of possible outputs of a\nneural network. Often, the verification is inconclusive due to the conservatism\nof the enclosure. To address this problem, we design a novel latent space for\nformal verification that enables the transfer of output specifications to the\ninput space for an iterative specification-driven input refinement, i.e., we\niteratively reduce the set of possible inputs to only enclose the unsafe ones.\nThe latent space is constructed from a novel view of projection-based set\nrepresentations, e.g., zonotopes, which are commonly used in reachability\nanalysis of neural networks. A projection-based set representation is a\n\"shadow\" of a higher-dimensional set -- a latent space -- that does not change\nduring a set propagation through a neural network. Hence, the input set and the\noutput enclosure are \"shadows\" of the same latent space that we can use to\ntransfer constraints. We present an efficient verification tool for neural\nnetworks that uses our iterative refinement to significantly reduce the number\nof subproblems in a branch-and-bound procedure. Using zonotopes as a set\nrepresentation, unlike many other state-of-the-art approaches, our approach can\nbe realized by only using matrix operations, which enables a significant\nspeed-up through efficient GPU acceleration.

In contrast, transformers scale linearly in\nFLOPs and, at best, linearly in memory during generation, since they must\nattend to all previous tokens explicitly. Despite this inference-time\nadvantage, training large RNNs on long contexts remains impractical because\nstandard optimization methods depend on Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT).\nBPTT requires retention of all intermediate activations during the forward\npass, causing memory usage to scale linearly with both context length and model\nsize. In this paper, we show that Zero-Order Optimization (ZOO) methods such as\nRandom-vector Gradient Estimation (RGE) can successfully replace BPTT to train\nRNNs with convergence rates that match, or exceed BPTT by up to 19 fold, while\nusing orders of magnitude less memory and cost, as the model remains in\ninference mode throughout training.

In the online\nsetting, where agents learn representations while exploring, the latent space\nevolves with the agent's policy, to capture newly discovered areas of the\nenvironment. However, without incentivization to maximize state coverage in the\nrepresentation, classical approaches based on auto-encoders may converge to\nlatent spaces that over-represent a restricted set of states frequently visited\nby the agent.

R1-Searcher++ employs a two-stage\ntraining strategy: an initial SFT Cold-start phase for preliminary format\nlearning, followed by RL for Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition. The RL stage uses\noutcome-supervision to encourage exploration, incorporates a reward mechanism\nfor internal knowledge utilization, and integrates a memorization mechanism to\ncontinuously assimilate retrieved information, thereby enriching the model's\ninternal knowledge. By leveraging internal knowledge and external search\nengine, the model continuously improves its capabilities, enabling efficient\nretrieval-augmented reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that R1-Searcher++\noutperforms previous RAG and reasoning methods and achieves efficient\nretrieval.

However, existing approaches face two\nfundamental limitations: Euclidean methods struggle to capture hierarchical\nstructures, while hyperbolic methods, despite their superior hierarchical\nmodeling, lack semantic understanding of user and item profiles and fail to\nprovide a principled mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation. To\naddress these challenges, we propose HERec, a hyperbolic graph-LLM framework\nthat effectively balances exploration and exploitation in recommender systems.\nOur framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a semantic-enhanced\nhierarchical mechanism that aligns rich textual descriptions processed by large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with collaborative information directly in hyperbolic\nspace, allowing for more nuanced updates that respect the underlying\nhierarchical structure in user-item profiles; (2) an automatic hierarchical\nrepresentation by optimizing Dasgupta's cost, which discovers hierarchical\nstructures without requiring predefined hyperparameters, enabling\nuser-adjustable exploration-exploitation trade-offs.

To address these co-existing distribution shifts, we propose a novel\nCausal-Invariant Cross-Domain Out-of-distribution Recommendation framework,\ncalled CICDOR.

The primary challenge involves preserving the visual\nauthenticity of the garment while dynamically adapting to the pose and physique\nof the subject. While existing methods have predominantly focused on\nimage-based virtual try-on, extending these techniques directly to videos often\nresults in temporal inconsistencies. Most current video virtual try-on\napproaches alleviate this challenge by incorporating temporal modules, yet\nstill overlook the critical spatiotemporal pose interactions between human and\ngarment. Effective pose interactions in videos should not only consider spatial\nalignment between human and garment poses in each frame but also account for\nthe temporal dynamics of human poses throughout the entire video. With such\nmotivation, we propose a new framework, namely Dynamic Pose Interaction\nDiffusion Models (DPIDM), to leverage diffusion models to delve into dynamic\npose interactions for video virtual try-on. Technically, DPIDM introduces a\nskeleton-based pose adapter to integrate synchronized human and garment poses\ninto the denoising network. A hierarchical attention module is then exquisitely\ndesigned to model intra-frame human-garment pose interactions and long-term\nhuman pose dynamics across frames through pose-aware spatial and temporal\nattention mechanisms. Moreover, DPIDM capitalizes on a temporal regularized\nattention loss between consecutive frames to enhance temporal consistency.\nExtensive experiments conducted on VITON-HD, VVT and ViViD datasets demonstrate\nthe superiority of our DPIDM against the baseline methods.

Nevertheless, the problem remains\nchallenging to preserve the shape and every detail of the given garment due to\nthe intrinsic stochasticity of diffusion model. To alleviate this issue, we\nnovelly propose to explicitly capitalize on visual correspondence as the prior\nto tame diffusion process instead of simply feeding the whole garment into UNet\nas the appearance reference. Specifically, we interpret the fine-grained\nappearance and texture details as a set of structured semantic points, and\nmatch the semantic points rooted in garment to the ones over target person\nthrough local flow warping. Such 2D points are then augmented into 3D-aware\ncues with depth/normal map of target person. The correspondence mimics the way\nof putting clothing on human body and the 3D-aware cues act as semantic point\nmatching to supervise diffusion model training.

Experiments across diverse multimodal\nVQA/KIE benchmarks and text reasoning datasets show that CAR outperforms both\nshort-answer and long-form reasoning approaches, striking an optimal balance\nbetween accuracy and efficiency.\n","authors":["Jinghui Lu","Haiyang Yu","Siliang Xu","Shiwei Ran","Guozhi Tang","Siqi Wang","Bin Shan","Teng Fu","Hao Feng","Jingqun Tang","Han Wang","Can Huang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15154v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14222v2","updated":"2025-05-21T05:45:46Z","published":"2025-05-20T11:30:28Z","title":"MatchDance: Collaborative Mamba-Transformer Architecture Matching for\n  High-Quality 3D Dance Synthesis","summary":"  Music-to-dance generation represents a challenging yet pivotal task at the\nintersection of choreography, virtual reality, and creative content generation.\nDespite its significance, existing methods face substantial limitation in\nachieving choreographic consistency.

Under ideal conditions, when\nthe user's perception aligns closely with the machine's perception of\nsimilarity, consistent and precise judgments can elevate the target to the top\nposition within a few iterations. However, in practical scenarios, expecting\nusers to provide consistent judgments is often unrealistic, especially when the\nunderlying embedding features used for similarity measurements lack\ninterpretability. To enhance robustness, we first introduce a pairwise relative\njudgment feedback that improves the stability of top-k selections by mitigating\nthe impact of misaligned feedback. Then, we decompose user perception into\nmultiple sub-perceptions, each represented as an independent embedding space.\nThis approach assumes that users may not consistently align with a single\nrepresentation but are more likely to align with one or several among multiple\nrepresentations. We develop a predictive user model that estimates the\ncombination of sub-perceptions based on each user feedback instance. The\npredictive user model is then trained to filter out the misaligned\nsub-perceptions.

The former evaluates the performance of identifying\nthe most relevant pages within a long document, while the later assesses the\nability of detecting specific layouts, providing a more fine-grained measure\nthan whole-page analysis. A layout refers to a variety of elements, including\ntextual paragraphs, equations, figures, tables, or charts. The MMDocIR\nbenchmark comprises a rich dataset featuring 1,685 questions annotated by\nexperts and 173,843 questions with bootstrapped labels, making it a valuable\nresource in multimodal document retrieval for both training and evaluation.\nThrough rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that (i) visual retrievers\nsignificantly outperform their text counterparts, (ii) MMDocIR training set\neffectively enhances the performance of multimodal document retrieval and (iii)\ntext retrievers leveraging VLM-text significantly outperforms retrievers\nrelying on OCR-text.

Despite attempts to study this\neffect, most prior work focuses on the embedding or gradient level bias,\noverlooking how topology bias fundamentally distorts the message passing\nprocess itself. We bridge this gap by providing an empirical and theoretical\nanalysis from a Dirichlet energy perspective, revealing that graph message\npassing inherently amplifies topology bias and consistently benefits highly\nconnected nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Test-time Simplicial\nPropagation (TSP), which extends message passing to higher-order simplicial\ncomplexes.

Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated\nincreasing influence in morally sensitive domains such as autonomous driving\nand medical analysis, owing to their powerful multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities. As these models are deployed in high-stakes real-world\napplications, it is of paramount importance to ensure that their outputs align\nwith human moral values and remain within moral boundaries. However, existing\nwork on moral alignment either focuses solely on textual modalities or relies\nheavily on AI-generated images, leading to distributional biases and reduced\nrealism. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MORALISE, a comprehensive\nbenchmark for evaluating the moral alignment of vision-language models (VLMs)\nusing diverse, expert-verified real-world data. We begin by proposing a\ncomprehensive taxonomy of 13 moral topics grounded in Turiel's Domain Theory,\nspanning the personal, interpersonal, and societal moral domains encountered in\neveryday life. Built on this framework, we manually curate 2,481 high-quality\nimage-text pairs, each annotated with two fine-grained labels: (1) topic\nannotation, identifying the violated moral topic(s), and (2) modality\nannotation, indicating whether the violation arises from the image or the text.\nFor evaluation, we encompass two tasks, \\textit{moral judgment} and\n\\textit{moral norm attribution}, to assess models' awareness of moral\nviolations and their reasoning ability on morally salient content.

Within\nthis process, document reranking plays a critical role by refining first-stage\nretrieval results. However, large language model (LLM) listwise reranking faces\nunique challenges in the scientific domain. First-stage retrieval is often\nsuboptimal in the scientific domain, so relevant documents are ranked lower.\nMoreover, conventional listwise reranking uses the full text of candidate\ndocuments in the context window, limiting the number of candidates that can be\nconsidered. As a result, many relevant documents are excluded before reranking,\nwhich constrains overall retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we\nexplore compact document representations based on semantic features such as\ncategories, sections, and keywords, and propose a training-free, model-agnostic\nreranking framework for scientific retrieval called CoRank. The framework\ninvolves three stages: (i) offline extraction of document-level features, (ii)\ncoarse reranking using these compact representations, and (iii) fine-grained\nreranking on full texts of the top candidates from stage (ii). This hybrid\ndesign provides a high-level abstraction of document semantics, expands\ncandidate coverage, and retains critical details required for precise ranking.\nExperiments on LitSearch and CSFCube show that CoRank significantly improves\nreranking performance across different LLM backbones, increasing nDCG@10 from\n32.0 to 39.7.

Given the dilemma, how can\nwe design a practical system that meets user needs? Our current work at Airbnb\nprovides an answer, with a working solution deployed at scale. We start with\npairwise learning-to-rank (LTR) models-the bedrock of search ranking tech\nstacks today. They scale linearly with the number of items ranked and perform\nstrongly on metrics like NDCG by learning from pairwise comparisons. They are\nat a sweet spot of performance vs. cost, making them an ideal choice for\nseveral industrial applications.

To improve accuracy,\nwe create a \"true\" pairwise LTR model-one that captures interactions between\nitems during pairwise comparisons. But accuracy comes at the expense of\nscalability and total order, and we discuss strategies to counter these\nchallenges. For greater accuracy, we take each item in the search result, and\ncompare it against the rest of the items along two dimensions: (1) Superiority:\nHow strongly do searchers prefer the given item over the remaining ones? (2)\nSimilarity: How similar is the given item to all the other items? This forms\nthe basis of our \"all-pairwise\" LTR framework, which factors in interactions\nacross all items at once.

We\nevaluate our work on top of Text2midi - an existing text-to-midi generation\nmodel, demonstrating significant improvements in both objective and subjective\nevaluation metrics.\n","authors":["Abhinaba Roy","Geeta Puri","Dorien Herremans"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12669v1.pdf","comment":"7 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables"}]},"2025-05-18T00:00:00Z":{"Multimedia":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12393v1","updated":"2025-05-18T12:43:10Z","published":"2025-05-18T12:43:10Z","title":"Protocol as Poetry: Case Study on Pak's Protocol Arts","summary":"  Protocol art emerges at the confluence of blockchain-based smart contracts\nand a century-long lineage of conceptual art, participatory art, and\nalgorithmic generative art practices. Yet existing definitions-most notably\nPrimavera De Filippi's \"protocolism\"-struggle to demarcate this nascent genre\nfrom other art forms in practice. Addressing this definition-to-practice gap,\nthis paper offers a focused case study of pioneering protocol artworks by Pak,\nan early and influential pseudonymous protocol artist who treats smart\ncontracts as medium and protocol participation as message. Tracing the\nevolution from early open-edition releases of The Fungible and the dynamic\nmechanics of Merge to the soul-bound messaging of Censored and the reflective\nabsence of Not Found, we examine how Pak choreographs distributed agency across\ncollectors and autonomous contracts, showing how programmable protocols become\na social fabric in artistic meaning-making. Through thematic analysis of Pak's\nworks, we identify seven core characteristics that distinguish protocol art:\n(1) system-centric rather than object-centric composition, (2) autonomous\ngovernance for open-ended control, (3) distributed agency and communal\nauthorship, (4) temporal dynamism and lifecycle aesthetics, (5) economic-driven\nengagement, (6) poetic message embedding in interaction rituals, and (7)\ninteroperability enabling composability for emergence. We then discuss how\nthese features set protocol art apart from adjacent artistic movements. By\ndeveloping a theoretical framework grounded in Pak's practice, we contribute to\nthe emerging literature on protocolism while offering design implications for\nartists shaping this evolving art form.\n","authors":["Botao Amber Hu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12393v1.pdf","comment":"Submitted to Ars Electronica Expanded Conference 2025 Research Paper"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06677v3","updated":"2025-05-18T06:50:03Z","published":"2025-03-09T16:05:36Z","title":"REArtGS: Reconstructing and Generating Articulated Objects via 3D\n  Gaussian Splatting with Geometric and Motion Constraints","summary":"  Articulated objects, as prevalent entities in human life, their 3D\nrepresentations play crucial roles across various applications. However,\nachieving both high-fidelity textured surface reconstruction and dynamic\ngeneration for articulated objects remains challenging for existing methods. In\nthis paper, we present REArtGS, a novel framework that introduces additional\ngeometric and motion constraints to 3D Gaussian primitives, enabling\nhigh-quality textured surface reconstruction and generation for articulated\nobjects. Specifically, given multi-view RGB images of arbitrary two states of\narticulated objects, we first introduce an unbiased Signed Distance Field (SDF)\nguidance to regularize Gaussian opacity fields, enhancing geometry constraints\nand improving surface reconstruction quality. Then we establish deformable\nfields for 3D Gaussians constrained by the kinematic structures of articulated\nobjects, achieving unsupervised generation of surface meshes in unseen states.\nExtensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate our\napproach achieves high-quality textured surface reconstruction for given\nstates, and enables high-fidelity surface generation for unseen states.
